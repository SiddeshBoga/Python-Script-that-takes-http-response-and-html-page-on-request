What does the Script do?

This script does the following:

Imports BaseHTTPRequestHandler and HTTPServer from the http.server module.
Defines a custom SimpleHTTPRequestHandler class which inherits from BaseHTTPRequestHandler and overrides the do_GET method to handle GET requests.
In the do_GET method:
Sets the response status code to 200.
Sets the Content-type header to indicate that the content is HTML.
Sends the HTML content as the response body.
Defines a run function which creates an instance of HTTPServer with our custom SimpleHTTPRequestHandler and starts serving on localhost at port 8000.
Executes the run function if the script is executed directly.
To use this script:

Save the code into a file named http_server.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing http_server.py.
Run the script using python http_server.py.
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the served HTML page.
This script creates a basic HTTP server that responds to GET requests with a simple HTML page. You can customize the HTML content and further extend the functionality as needed for your specific use case.
